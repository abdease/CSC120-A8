- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
    My class represents a garden that the user can explore. It is somewhat Alice-in-Wonderland-esque, with the user being able to shrink, grow, and even fly. The user can also grab, drop, or examine any of the items in the garden. The garden has a set size, and the user can navigate through the garden in any of the four cardinal directions, and can even fly to different (x,y) coordinates in the garden. There are currently only three set items in the garden, but the user can interact with these in set ways with grab, drop, examine, and use methods.
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
    The only additional method I implemented was the welcome method, which just prints a message welcoming the user to the garden.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    The most difficult part was implemented the undo method. I wanted it to allow the user to undo their last action, but this was not easy to implement, so instead undo just prints a statement that signifies that the user put back their most recently grabbed item.
